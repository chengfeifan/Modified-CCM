# Modified-CCM
This method is firstly proposed by the sugihara.

## What the modification
Sugihara proposed the **CCM** (Convergent Cross Mapping) for detecting the causality of the ecology system. When I apply this method to the chemical process. This method seems not to be so valid. So I modify this method:
-Use the statistics method to sample the orginal data, in order to avoid the manifold merged
